   Zambia hails result

 



  LUSAKA -- Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa yesterday hailed the 
re-election of his Zimbabwean counterpart Robert Mugabe and 
called on defeated opponent Morgan Tsvangirai to accept the 
controversial result.

  "I am pleased to learn of the re-election of President Robert 
Mugabe as president of Zimbabwe," Mwanawasa said in a statement.

  "As chairman of the Organisation of African Unity and president 
of a friendly neighbour, I congratulate President Mugabe on his 
re-election," Mwanawasa said.

  Three of the 10 losing presidential candidates in Zambia's 
December 27 vote have petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify 
the results, charging that Mwanawasa won the election by fraud.
