He will be visiting Ulan-Bator on March 25 and 26, and Hanoi on March 26 to 28. In Mongolia Kasyanov is to meet with Mongolian Prime Minister Nambaryn Enkhbayar, parliament Chairman Timur Ogir and President Natsagiyin Bagabandi. The plan of Kasyanov's visit also included expanded talks and the signing of bilateral documents. The Russian prime minister will meet with Mongolian and Russian businessmen. The main goal of the visit is to broaden economic cooperation between the two countries, whose present-day pace is not fast enough. Russian-Mongolian trade currently amounts to $240 million and makes up only 25% of Mongolia's foreign trade turnover. Mongolia's negative balance in trade with Russia increased from $150 million in 2000 to $160 million in 2001. Russia has proposed improving the situation by increasing exports of Mongolian meat to Russia. In recent years, three joint ventures - the Erdenet mining company, the Mongolian-Russian Non-Ferrous Metals Company and the Ulan- Bator Railways, have accounted for 60% of the Mongolian exports and 40% of the GDP. Russia would like to increase its stake in Erdenet from the current 49%, but Mongolia is also interested in increasing its 51% stake. This issue is likely to be discussed in Ulan-Bator, since the 1991 agreement on this company expires on December 31, 2002. Among other projects which Russian companies would like to implement in Mongolia are the laying of a gas pipeline from Russia to China (Yukos), the gasification of individual districts of Mongolia (Gazprom, Itera) and electricity exports to Mongolia (Unified Energy Systems of Russia.) Mongolia is one of the few members of the former social camp to which Russia does not owe anything. On the contrary, Mongolia's debt to Russia on current operations amounts to $10 million, and its Soviet-era debt to $11.5 billion. Russia is prepared to discuss restructuring and deferment schemes with the Mongolian leadership. Military cooperation, curtailed in the 1990s and now being resumed, will also be on the agenda. The parties are to discuss the training of Mongolian military personnel at Russian military academies and arms exports. Kasyanov will fly to Hanoi from Ulan-Bator on March 26.
