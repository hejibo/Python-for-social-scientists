 Seoul, Nov. 16 (Yonhap) -- The number of employees working on a temporary or daily basis have increased drastically as companies moved to slash labor costs after the financial crisis in 1997, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said Friday. NSO statistics showed that the number of workers employed on a temporary and daily basis rose by 888,000 to 6,962,000 in October compared with late 1997. The number working on a temporary basis went from 4,182,000 in late 1997 to 4,641,000 last month and that for those hired on a daily basis surged to 2,321,000 from 1,892,000 during the cited period. The number of full-time workers declined 626,000 to 6,525,000 during the same time span. "Demand for those working on a temporary or daily basis is risiing because companies are trying to save labor costs amid the continued economic slowdown," an NSO official said. Over 90 percent of full-time workers receive retirement allowances and bonuses but the comparable numbers fell to 10 percent for temporary workers and 1 percent for those employed on a daily basis. About 80 to 90 percent of full-time workers were registered for the national pension, employment and health insurance systems while the comparable numbers shrank to 20 percent and 2 to 3 percent for temporary workers and those hired on a daily basis, respectively. hdh@yna.co.kr
