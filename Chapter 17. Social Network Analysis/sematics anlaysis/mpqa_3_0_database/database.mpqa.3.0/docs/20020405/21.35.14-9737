This was the response by the Israeli army to the demand made by the Russian Orthodox Church to leave the Pilgrim's House so as not to undermine the peacekeeping mission of the Moscow Patriarchy in the Holy Land. The press service for the Israeli army told Interfax on Thursday that "now, it is in a state of war, and at such a time, it uses all possible points of observation." The army representatives said "it is necessary to reduce possible civilian casualties, including among the Palestinians." "During the military operation in Bethlehem, a necessity emerged to enter the Pilgrim's House and to use it for surveillance. But once the military tasks are fulfilled, the Israeli soldiers will leave this building," the press service said. The representatives told Interfax that Israeli soldiers "strictly adhere to moral norms, respecting sanctuaries of all religions, and will act the same in the next stages of the war against terrorism." The Israeli army has also strongly denied reports about an assault on the Cathedral of the Nativity in Bethlehem, which allegedly began recently. "Contrary to some media reports, Israeli soldiers are not storming into the church, but they have to respond to continual fire by Palestinian snipers, who have taken positions near the church," the press service said. The representatives of the Israeli armed forces said that "rumors about the assault have been prompted by false information, which is being circulated among foreign journalists by Palestinian sources."
