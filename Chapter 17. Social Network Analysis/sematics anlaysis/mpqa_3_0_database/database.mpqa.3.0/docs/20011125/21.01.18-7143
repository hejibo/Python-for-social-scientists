The replacement force will also include a Luxembourg contingent -- as has been the case since 1999 -- as well as a Romanian company including 84 troops. The army announced this on Friday [23 November]. The relief operation, which will involve some 900 troops, will begin on Saturday and last until 12 December, the Armed Forces' press service pointed out.
