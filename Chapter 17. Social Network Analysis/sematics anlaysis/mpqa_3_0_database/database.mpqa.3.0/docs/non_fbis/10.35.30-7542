  BEIJING: China on Thursday slammed increasingly close ties 
between the United States and Taiwan, demanding an end to 
official exchanges between the two and to US weapons sales.

  "The continual sale of arms by the United States or upgrading of 
relations with Taiwan will only lead to tensions across the 
straits," foreign ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said.

  "We demand the US strictly abide by the commitments it has made 
to China, correct its erroneous acts or remarks so as to avoid 
new harm to China-US relations."

  Zhang further expressed alarm over Washington's announcement on 
Wednesday that defense department officials will soon visit 
Taiwan to discuss the sale of eight diesel electric submarines.

  "China has always resolutely opposed any form of official 
exchanges or military intercourse between the United States and 
Taiwan," Zhang said.

  "The Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue at 
the core of Sino-US relations," she said at the biweekly 
ministry briefing.

  Military tensions in the Taiwan Strait were "not in the 
self-interests of the United States," she warned.

  She refused to confirm an April 26 to May 3 visit by Chinese 
Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington, as reported in the Hong 
Kong press. The visit, if Beijing allows it, is widely expected 
to be centered on China's dissatisfaction over the Taiwan issue.

  China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949 and 
has threatened to bring it back by force if it continues to 
indefinitely refuse proposals for "peaceful reunification."

  Beijing has also long refused to establish diplomatic relations 
with any nation that maintains official contact with Taiwan, 
although it has encouraged economic exchanges between Taiwan and 
all nations.

  Zhang also bashed remarks made last month by US Deputy Defense 
Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at a meeting in Florida, attended by 
visiting Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yao-Ming.

  "The United States is committed to doing whatever it takes to 
help Taiwan defend itself," said Wolfowitz, echoing President 
George W. Bush's remarks made when he first took office last 
year.

  "Our position is clear," he continued. "We don't support Taiwan 
independence, but we oppose the use of force."

  Wolfowitz expressed concern about China's continuing deployment 
of forces and tactical missiles to areas across the straits from 
Taiwan.

  US officials denied Wolfowitz's remarks reflected a change in US 
policy on Taiwan.

  Zhang said: "The remarks of the US official are a ... violation 
of US commitments made (on Taiwan) and interference in China 
internal affairs. China is firmly opposed to the remarks."

  Chinese missile tests over Taiwan in 1996 resulted in Washington 
deploying two aircraft carrier battle groups to the region.
