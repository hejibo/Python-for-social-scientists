 CFL President Lin Hui-kuan led the Taiwan delegation to the meeting in the name of observer of the International Confederation of Free Trade Union (ICFTU). It was the first time that a Taiwan labor group has been invited to participate in a meeting of the ILO, which is an affiliate of the United Nations. 
	
	
 The CFL's participation in the meeting did not meet with any objection from Beijing, as it attended as an observer of a non-U.N. organization. Beijing opposes Taiwan's participation in any international organization in which sovereignty is a prerequisite. 
	
	
 Lin told CNA that the CFL gained high appraisal in its efforts to protect the rights of Thai, Filipino, Indonesian and Vietnamese workers in Taiwan. 
	
	
 Taiwan is the only country in Asia that allows foreign laborers to enjoy the same salary levels as their local counterparts, which elevates its image in international society, Lin added. 
	
	
 He indicated that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, it has signed two international agreements related to labor affairs and abides by all the regulations stipulated by the ILO. 
	
	
 Recently, Lin added, the Republic of China government was about to eliminate the minimum wage requirement for foreign workers mainly due to pressure from the business sector. However, through the protests of local labor groups, foreign laborers' working rights were protected, bringing extra attention to the power of Taiwan labor groups. 
	
	
 Lin noted that Taiwan is one of the ICFTU founders and that its participation in the ILO can serve as a model for Taiwan to take part in international activities. 
	
	
 Lin and his delegation are scheduled to return home Sept. 1 after the quadrennial meeting.
