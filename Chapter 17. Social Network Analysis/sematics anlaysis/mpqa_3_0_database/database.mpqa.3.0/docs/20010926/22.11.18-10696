 The businessman, who identified himself as Ivan Ivanov and has worked in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates, told AFP that a group of Pakistani nationals introduced him to bin Laden, the prime suspect in the US terrorist attacks, on April 10 in Peshawar. 
	
	
 A young Arab chemical engineer contacted him the next day, he said, to ask him to act as an intermediary in the sale of the nuclear fuel from the Kozlodui nuclear power plant. 
	
	
 The businessman said he turned down an offer of a 200,000 dollar commission for the sale. 
	
	
 The head of the nuclear energy department at Bulgaria's energy agency separately said he could not imagine a terrorist organisation making a bomb out of products from the reactors at the Kozlodui power station. 
	
	
 "There is no possibility of legally selling the nuclear waste. They are stockpiled in a secure depot located inside the power station before being sent to Russia to be processed," said Anton Ivanov.
