 Seoul, Aug. 29 (Yonhap) -- LG Electronics Co. said Wednesday that it has established a code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile phone service system in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to begin service on Sept. 1, Uzbekistan's Independence Day. The opening ceremony for the CDMA system was held there Monday with LG Electronics Co. President Park Chung-gun, Uzbek Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Isaev, Perfect Mobile President Alexey Martinson and other dignitaries attending, an LG spokesman said. LG signed a contract in March for the shipment of the CDMA equipment with Perfect Mobile, which has the exclusive right to do CDMA business in the central Asian state. LG has established 30,000 circuits of 800 Megahertz CDMA system in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital, and is planning to increase the facility to up to 200,000 circuits by 2004. LG also plans to upgrade the current system beginning 2002. President Park said that the opening of the LG CDMA mobile phone service in Uzbekistan will have an impact on neighboring central Asian states. "We hope that this will serve as an occasion for LG to make inroads into the Central Asian region." Uzbekistan is the largest country in central Asia with a population of 23 million and rich in natural resources. The state-run Uzbektelecom and four private companies offering services in the Global System for Mobile Communications (GMS) has about 100,000 subscribers. hdh@yna.co.kr
