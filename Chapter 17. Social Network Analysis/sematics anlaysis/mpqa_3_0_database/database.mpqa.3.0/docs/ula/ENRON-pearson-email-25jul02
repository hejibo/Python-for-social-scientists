HOWDY,

WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AMIGO.  I HAVE NOT TALKED TO YOU IN A WHILE.  GIVE YOU
THE SCOPE OF WHATS BEEN GOING ON WITH ME.  I LEFT OILSTATES BACK IN MARCH
WITH ANOTHER COMPANY.  DID A LOT OF TRAVELING AND THEY (OILSTATES) MADE ME A
SWEET OFFER TO COME BACK.  SO I AM BACK.

WHO'S GETTING MARRIED?  SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT BACHELOR
PARTY.  GIVE ME A CALL SOMETIME CELL: 713 991 - 5621.

ROB
