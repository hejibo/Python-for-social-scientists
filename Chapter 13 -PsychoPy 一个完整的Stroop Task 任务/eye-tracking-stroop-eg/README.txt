Tobii T60XL setup notes with PsychoPy
-------------------------------------

1) Follow machine setup and library steps within the how-to.pdf
2) Pytables is a pain to setup, be warned!
3) Test the stroop_test to ensure it all works in this directory

Experiment notes
----------------
1) See the code examples and code blocks in both initialization and calibration
2) Window shrink stuff is a pain, but it works
3) Tobii_std.yaml is key and is aligned to our T60XL at present, including sample rate
4) One demo for graze testing, another for data saving (commented)

Watch out for eyexl errors on 1.83 or above.
