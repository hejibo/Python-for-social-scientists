 Moscow, 29 November: Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has arrived in Moscow to attend the 10th anniversary summit of the Commonwealth of Independent States, said upon his arrival on Thursday [29 November] that "certain apathy" to the commonwealth has developed in the CIS member countries. Making his point clear, he said that the former Soviet republics "have not completely fallen apart, but have not formed a sufficiently strong alliance on a new basis either". He said, however, that a real unification will take place after all, since the CIS countries have far more reasons for a union that the European Union countries. He said this tendency reflects the economic and cultural traditions of the CIS countries which were formerly part of the Soviet Union. The current summit will hopefully allow the CIS countries to lay new ways towards rapprochement. Concerning the delimitation of the border between Kazakhstan and Russia, Nazarbayev said that this process is continuing without any disagreements and with mutual respect for each other's interests, and that documents on the final delimitation are likely to be signed next year. Getting back to the problem of broadening all-round cooperation between the CIS countries, Nazarbayev said that a new factor - globalization - is accelerating this process. "We cannot stand on the sidelines of this global tendency," the Kazakh president said.
