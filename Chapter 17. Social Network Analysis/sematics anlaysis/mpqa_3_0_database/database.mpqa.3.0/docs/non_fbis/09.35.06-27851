  LONDON: British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday 
there was already "pretty strong" early evidence that President 
Robert Mugabe had "stolen" the election in Zimbabwe.

  Although he refused to make a final judgement on the conduct of 
the weekend presidential poll, he told parliament that if Mugabe 
was declared the winner of a rigged vote, it would have 
"enormous implications" for London's ties with Harare. "If it 
becomes clear, and the evidence is already pretty strong, that 
President Mugabe, in the event he is declared the winner, has 
stolen the election, then that has enormous implications for the 
nature of our relationship with Zimbabwe," he warned.

  "This is a terrible period, not only for Zimbabwe but for those 
who hold the course of democracy dear in Africa and elsewhere." 
Counting in the election, in which Mugabe is battling for his 
political future against opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai 
after 22 years in power, began Tuesday amid complaints in 
Zimbabwe over the conduct of the vote.

  A group of independent local observers said the electoral 
process was neither free nor fair and could spark fresh violence 
in the southern African country. Straw said there had been 
"every sign" of intimidation by Mugabe's Zanu-PF party up to the 
close of polls as well as many reports of irregularities since 
then, including shortage of polling booths in urban areas and 
harassment of opposition election agents in rural areas.
