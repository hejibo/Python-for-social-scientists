 The carrying out of the operations in Afghanistan and their mistakes have caused unease in the ruling majority's ranks in Belgium. Some senators spoke about this on Mise au Point [programme] on the television. The PRL [Liberal Reform Party] and the PSC [Christian Social Party] opposition party continue to support the strikes but criticize the fact that the humanitarian operations are taking place alongside them. Ecolo and Agalev [ecologist parties] are asking for the ending of the bombing of Afghanistan. For the PS [Socialist Party], Senator Jean Cornil still supports them, while being increasingly critical. Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has announced on Flemish television that Europe will discuss the American actions in Afghanistan next Friday [19 October] in Gent [northwest of Brussels] during the informal [EU] heads of state and government summit.
