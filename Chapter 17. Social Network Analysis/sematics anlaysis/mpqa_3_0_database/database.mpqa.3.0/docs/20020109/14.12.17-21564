Jan 8 (Interfax-AVN) - Two citizens of Iraq were detained on the Russian border on Monday when they attempted to cross into the country illegally from Azerbaijan, a spokesman for the North Caucasus regional border guard department told Interfax- Military News Agency. The two detainees aged 26 were taken to a picket of the Derbent border guard detachment for a probe into the incident. Servicemen of the Sochi border guard department protecting a section of the Russian-Georgian frontier apprehended another violator on Monday, the spokesman said. A 33-year-old citizen of Romania tried to enter Russia illegally from Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia. According to the spokesman, heavy snowfalls and the risk of avalanches still limit the traffic on the Caucasus highway and Military Georgian highway. The Nizhny Zaramag checkpoint on the Russian-Georgian border is closed temporarily. The Verkhny Lars checkpoint is operating, but the number of people using it is very small. As many as 117 people and 58 vehicles crossed the border through that checkpoint on Monday, the spokesman said. @ 2002 Interfax-Military News Agency, All rights reserved.
