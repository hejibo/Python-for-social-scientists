 A Foreign Office spokesman said: "I can confirm a team of British officials are in the process of visiting the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. They arrived overnight. 
	
	
 "They are going about their task that has been set for them, identifying those who claim to be British citizens and reporting on the welfare of those who claim to be British citizens and assisting the US authorities with legal inquiries into the terrorist atrocities." 
	
	
 The United States earlier this week said British diplomats could have access to Britons held among the detainees, whose cramped and spartan conditions have caused much criticism among human rights groups around the world. 
	
	
 London insists it supports US reassurances that the men are being treated humanely, although there has also been criticism here over why it was taking diplomats so long to see the men. 
	
	
 The prisoners are being held at a temporary outdoor detention facility called "Camp X-Ray" where each has a separate cell with a concrete floor, wooden roof and chain-link walls. They have a mat to sleep on and two towels, one to be used as a prayer rug. 
	
	
 A four-member International Red Cross team flew into the US navy base on Cuban soil on Thursday and was due to begin interviewing detainees later Friday. 
	
	
 A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to say how many British officials had travelled to the camp.
