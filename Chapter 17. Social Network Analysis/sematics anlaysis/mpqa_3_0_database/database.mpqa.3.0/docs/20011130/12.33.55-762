 Taipei, Nov. 29 (CNA) -- Thirty political observers from around the world are slated to participate in an international symposium on democratic consolidation, peace and security to be held in Taipei Sunday. 
	
	
 The experts and scholars will be divided into discussion panels that will address the significance of Taiwan's elections and its democratic consolidation, a comparative analysis of democratic elections and Taiwan's democracy in the Asia Pacific region. A roundtable discussion will also take place. 
	
	
 According to the Government Information Office (GIO), which is co-sponsoring the symposium with National Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations, the symposium is being held to provide the world with a greater understanding of Taiwan's role in regional stability. 
	
	
 The GIO added that Taiwan's accomplishment in democratization is the "best role model" for mainland China's progress toward democracy. 
	
	
 Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen is scheduled to deliver a keynote speech at the symposium to explain the government's policy toward mainland China. 
	
	
 Some of the visiting experts from 10 countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Japan, have been arriving since Wednesday to call on key government agencies and local political leaders ahead of Saturday's elections for legislators, county chiefs and city mayors. 
	
	
 In a meeting with 25 of the scholars Thursday, Tsai said in response to a question on whether Taiwan is afraid of over-reliance on the mainland market that the island will be able to achieve balanced economic growth as long as it strikes a balance between maintaining its sovereignty, developing its economy globally and normalizing relations with the mainland.
