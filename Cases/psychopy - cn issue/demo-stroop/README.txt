Stroop - measuring reaction times to incongruent stimuli
------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiment: 
    
    In this task subjects must report the colour of the letters spelling each
    word, but letters themselves also spell a colour name and this may be the
    same or different to the colour of the letters. Stroop (1935) reports that
    reaction times are slower the letters spell a colour that is incongruent
    with the colour of the letters, indicating a compulsory automated reading of
    the word.

Analysing your data:

    After you run the study, look in the data/ folder next to where the 
    experiment was saved. There will be an xlsx file there that can be opened
    with Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet package. Each row represents
    one condition (trial type) and each column is one variable of your experiment
    or type of data collected. 
    Take the average of the resp.mean_rt column for the 3 congruent conditions 
    and compare them with the 3 incongruent conditions. In most cases the 
    incongruent conditions will have larger reactions times. 

Notes: 
    
    This version of the Stroop effect is a very simple experiment, good for 
    explaining how the PsychoPy Builder interface works with minimal clutter. 
    You could (as a challenge) add practice trials and feedback if you liked...
    or you could go to the StroopExtended demo and see how to do it there!
