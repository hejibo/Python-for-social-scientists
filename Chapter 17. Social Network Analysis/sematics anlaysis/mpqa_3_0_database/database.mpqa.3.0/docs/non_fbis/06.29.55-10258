U.S. Tells China Taiwan Remarks a Mistake - Xinhua

 



  BEIJING -- The United States told China U.S. President George W. 
Bush had made a mistake when he called Taiwan a country in a 
speech last week, the official Xinhua news agency reported on 
Sunday.

  Washington told China the U.S. government has not changed its 
Taiwan policy and said it would not refer to Taiwan in that way 
again, Xinhua quoted a foreign ministry spokeswoman as saying.

  Reports in Taiwanese newspapers on Friday said Bush called the 
island the "Republic of Taiwan" and a "country" in a speech to 
diplomats and business executives on Thursday.

  Calling Taiwan a country would threaten to compromise a major 
pillar of Sino-U.S. relations, which were set up in 1979 largely 
based on a U.S. nod to the "One China" Principle, which states 
that Taiwan is a part of China, Reuters reported.

  Beijing, which regards the island as a wayward province to be 
reunited with the mainland by force if necessary, asked for an 
explanation on Saturday of why Bush had referred to Taiwan as a 
country.

  Taiwan's ***United Daily News ***quoted a U.S. official as 
saying Bush's labeling Taiwan as a republic was a "slip of the 
tongue" and indicated no shift in U.S. policy.

  Bush was referring to the entry late last year and this year of 
China and Taiwan, respectively, into the World Trade 
Organization, reports said.

  The English-language ***Taipei Times ***newspaper quoted Bush as 
saying it was "important to recognize and to welcome both 
countries, both the Republic of Taiwan, and of course China, 
into the World Trade Organization."

  The Taiwan issue has often caused rough patches in bilateral 
ties and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have angered Beijing.

  Last month an editorial in the official ***China Daily *** 
newspaper said Beijing felt "betrayed" after a U.S. decision to 
allow Taiwanese Defense Minister Tang Yiau-Ming into the United 
States for talks with Defense officials and warned of a setback 
in Sino-U.S. ties.

  But foreign ministry officials later confirmed both sides were 
moving ahead with plans for a scheduled visit by Chinese 
Vice-President Hu Jintao to the United States in late April.
