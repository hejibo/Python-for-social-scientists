FLORIDA ASTRONAUTS REPAIR SPACE STATION WINGS

  CAPE CANAVERAL -- Two space-walking astronauts went out on a 
repair job Monday and wrapped thermal covers around a pair of 
motors that turn the International Space Station's giant solar 
wings.

  NASA hopes the covers will shield the motors against the 
temperature extremes of space and eliminate power spikes and 
stalls. The motors keep the solar wings pointing toward the sun 
and generating electricity.

  Astronauts Linda Godwin and Daniel Tani floated out of space 
shuttle Endeavour and grabbed onto the ship's robot arm for a 
50-foot ride up the side of the space station.
