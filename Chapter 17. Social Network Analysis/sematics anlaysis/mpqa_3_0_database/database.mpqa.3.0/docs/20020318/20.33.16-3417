He told IRNA in an interview on Monday, "America has killed thousands of innocent people in almost all parts of the globe particularly in the Muslim world. America, in the guise of its so-called war on terror, has killed and injured thousands of innocent Afghans and the prisoners of war are maltreated." A couple of weeks ago, the US state department in its annual report had revealed that Iran, Pakistan and some other countries are the violators of human rights. "America has a double standard policy. It denounces human rights violation but supports Israel for perishing the Muslims in Palestine and Lebanon," Abbas criticized. He said those countries and nations which are independant in real sense of the world and do not take dictation from the US or accepts its supremacy are labelled as human rights violators. "Those who submit to its policies are showered upon favours," he added. "America always follows its interests. In its so-called war against terrorism and against weapons of mass destruction lies its covert motive and that is its strategic and economic interests," Abbas added. However, he hoped that the people of the world can no more be kept in dark. "They can see and observe the unjust and discriminatory policies of America. People do not believe whatever the America says," he concluded.
