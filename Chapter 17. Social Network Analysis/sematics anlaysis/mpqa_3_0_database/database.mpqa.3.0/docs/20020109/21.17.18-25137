 Ever since then, the Senate's work has been subject to increasing criticisms, including from groups that support a possible law on euthanasia. The criticisms mainly focus on the applicability of the Senate's bill, the lack of a palliative filter prior to committing euthanasia, the supervisory role of the assessment committee, which is likely to be understaffed, and the nonexistence of fixed penalties for unjustifiable cases of euthanasia. 
	
	
 The Chamber will treat the bill differently than the Senate, which worked with a joint justice and public health committee. The Chamber's health, environment, and social emancipation committee will only have an advisory role. Yesterday [8 January], this committee initiated a hearing on palliative care. It includes a few VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] deputies who are very critical of the senators' work. According to the CD&amp;amp;V [Christian Democratic and Flemish], this is why this committee has only been given an advisory function. 
	
	
 Moreover, the Chamber's justice committee seems to want to go it alone regarding the euthanasia debate. This committee is scheduled to start the debate on the Senate's euthanasia bill today. 
	
	
 However, SP.A [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party - Different] Deputy Fred Erdman has drafted his own bill "regarding the problems connected with terminating one's life and the condition of terminally ill patients." VLD Floor Leader Hugo Coveliers and party member Maggie De Block also have a bill on euthanasia. A resolution proposed by Yolande Avondroodt (VLD) requesting working out a "palliative care plan according to a patient's needs" is based on this bill. 
	
	
 The Chamber apparently wants to push ahead with the debate on euthanasia because available speaking time is very limited.
