A former director-general of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Hameed Gul told IRNA in an interview here that each country which resisted American hegemony was deemed a violator of human rights. "In a fit of force, the US wanted to subjugate the entire world community and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle in this direction and the recent report on human rights was also a manifestation of its hegemonistic designs," the lieutenant general (retd) continued. Hameed Gul was of the opinion that the US was the only country in the world that had no respect for any religion, faith, norms, decency, human rights and rules. "It is unprecedented in the history of the comity of nations that the US forcibly wanted to prevent countries from upholding religious and cultural values," he said. "The US is the most fraudulent, terrorist and extremist country. The world would never forget the barbarities it committed on the innocent Afghan people, women, children and the elderly," he firmly said. In order to realize its vested interests in the region, he said the US and its allies unleashed oppression against the Afghan people and used latest weaponry against the defenseless nation. In this regard, he made a quick reference to the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims. "Since the rioting erupted last week, over 600 people, mostly Muslims, have been brutally murdered in the hands of extremist Hindus in India, but the US and other so-called civilized nations kept a shameful mum," he remarked. The Americans, he pointed out, see violations of human rights when a country or a group of people become hurdles in the realization of their vested interests. "What Israel is doing in Palestine against the Muslims is also one of the worst examples of rights abuses but the US is again silent, but when Palestinians react to Israeli attacks America is quick to The logical solution to the Palestinian issue is a free and independent state for the people of Palestine as enshrined under UN resolutions, he said. But the US is denying this, he added. He said it clearly means that the Muslims have no right to defend themsleves against their oppressors. "America wants total submission of Muslims across the globe," Hameed Gul said. "The situation requires a concerted moral resistance by Muslims scholars; if they remain indifferent to each other's plight in the hands of imperialist forces led by the US, they would be crushed one by one," he warned. Muslims rulers should forge unity in their ranks to resist the ever-increasing US influence; otherwise, they would be targeted one by one, Hameed Gul concluded.
