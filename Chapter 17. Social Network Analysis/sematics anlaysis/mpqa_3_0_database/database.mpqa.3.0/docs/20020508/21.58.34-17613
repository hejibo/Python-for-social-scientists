Talking to IRNA, Ivashev expressed regrets over the fact that the people in some parts of the world are indifferent toward the expansionist policies of the United States and do not proceed to condemn them. He strongly criticized the US war-mongering actions and tactics and said the US war-mongering has posed serious threats to the world. He said the United States has turned into an axis of evil itself and is ignoring even the resolutions issued by the United Nations. Ivashev further said Russia is to develop its relations with the Muslim nations as well as China and India. He said there are deep differences between Russia and the United Stats on a range of strategic, political and economic issues. He said the US officials claim as for the countries described as "parts of an axis of evil" are "unfounded" and the US claims in this connection are "sheer lies". Reacting to the threats launched by the US president George W. Bush against Iran he condemned the United States expansionist policies. US President George W. Bush had in his State of the Union address termed Iran, Iraq and North Korea as "axis of evil" and accused them of attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction. Ivashev further said the United States is after gaining superiority over Russia's nuclear capabilities and initiating an anti-missile defense system by the United States shows that country's intentions. He said the United States is after imposing its expansionists policies under the pretext of the fight against terrorism.
