The expenditure has not increased much from 2000, since during that year it totalled Fr3.255 billion. The financial impact of operations in Afghanistan, which are expected to mobilize some 5,000 men, will not take effect until 2002. Outside Afghanistan, and outside Africa, under the terms of its defense agreements, France has deployed in 2001 some 10,750 members of its Armed Forces and of the gendarmerie, most of the personnel being stationed in Kosovo (5,890) and Bosnia-Herzegovina (2,820.)
