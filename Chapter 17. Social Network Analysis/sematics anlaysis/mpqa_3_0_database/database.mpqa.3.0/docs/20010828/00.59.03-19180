Coastwatch Australia says the boat is 75 nautical miles from Christmas Island [Australian territory in the Indian Ocean], but is still in Indonesian waters. 
	
	
 Indonesia has notified merchant shipping in the area to check if the boat needs any assistance. There has been an unconfirmed report that a Norwegian ship has reached the vessel. 
	
	
 Earlier Australia's immigration minister, Philip Ruddock, said it was believed the boat was carrying 80 people. Coastwatch Australia has maintained surveillance flights in the area for the past two days and will continue flights tomorrow.
