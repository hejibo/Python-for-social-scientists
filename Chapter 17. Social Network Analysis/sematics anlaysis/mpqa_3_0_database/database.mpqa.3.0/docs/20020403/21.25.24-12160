Russian First Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Ivan Matlashov made this announcement during a bilateral roundtable discussion coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the USSR-Iraq Friendship and Cooperation Treaty. Russian companies will have exported 118.6 million barrels of oil from Iraq during the six-month phase ending on May 29, Matlashov said. During the 10th phase, lasting between June and November 2001, Russian companies sold 115.3 million barrels. Russian companies will have sold around 1 billion barrels of Iraqi crude for approximately $15 billion during all 11 phases stipulated in the 1996 Iraq-UN memorandum. This accounts for roughly 40% of Iraq's total oil exports, he said. In April, the UN Sanctions Committee will probably lift restrictions from Russia-Iraq contracts in different spheres valued at about $900 million. The United Nations has allowed the implementation of contracts worth some $200 million. Of this, Russia's Zarubezhneft foreign trade organization secured 45 contracts valued at about $140 million. Zarubezhneft has shipped $45 million worth of equipment and materials in keeping with 33 contracts. The Iraqi side has pledged to "take into consideration the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry's recommendations" related to allocation of oil export quotas to its Russian partners.
