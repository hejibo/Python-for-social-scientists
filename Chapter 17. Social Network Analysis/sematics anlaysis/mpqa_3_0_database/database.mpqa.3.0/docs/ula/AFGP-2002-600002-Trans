Thoughts about Security of Principal Squads

Praise Allah who said provide those who believed with security and peace be
upon our prophet.

The enemy confronting our society falls in three categories:
1. Hostile intelligence organizations, such as the United States, Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, Pakistan and the Jews.

2. The straying group who are atheists and apostates.

3. The existing environment. They include the deposed regime, the tribal cliques,
the hired fighters, and the standard criminals.

The above groups pose the following dangers:
1. Attacking for the purpose of:
  a. Assassination
  b. Kidnapping
  c. Aerial raids and artillery attacks
2. Sabotage
   a. Setting fires
   b. Explosions
   c. Technical sabotage
   d. Chemical sabotage
3. Spying
   a. Recruiting a member of society
   b. Planting a mole within society
   c. Spying surveillance operation
4. Stealing
5. Pests:
   a. Poisonous such as snakes and scorpions
   b. Harmful such as rats and cockroaches
   c. Sickening such as mosquitoes

In order to face these dangers, we resort to a plan which includes the external
factors, the internal factors and spying.
External: All actions and methods adopted to confront dangers from outside.
 Internal: All actions and methods adopted to confront dangers from within.
Spying: Confronting infiltration operations carried out by spying agents or moles.

Chapter One
External Security

First: Choosing the Location
1. Choosing mountainous locations, preferably 1-3 hours from main cities, which
have water resources.
2. Being close to cities is important in order to have important services.
3. If a mountainous location is unviable, then choose a location next to official
  Buidings so as to avoid being bombarded.
4. Again, if the above is not possible, then choose a location next to residential
   areas, for the same reason as above.
5. The location should be away from airports and main highways. It is preferable
   it has its own private access in order to protect it and control it better.

Second: Protection Methods
1. Outside Protection:
  a. Barriers, walls, parking lots.
  b. Human protection
     - Patrols close to locations
     - Patrols distant from the location.
  c. Animal protection: Dogs
  d. Electronic protection: Cameras, alarm equipment, night vision
     equipment...etc.

Permanent Protection:

*Barriers
They are erected according to the nature of the location. They can take one of the
following forms:
-1. Steel pipes: Insert 4 inch pipes in the ground at 50 centimeters apart and a
height of one meter then fill them with cement.
-2. Barrels: They are filled with cement and place around the building, especially
at the entrance to prevent cars from crashing into it.
 3. Ditches: They are better than road bumps because they are harder to see. The
  ditch should be 30 centimeters deep and 20 centimeters wide. Passage ways for
  cars and pedestrians should be designated.

4. Road bumps: Six successive bumps should be constructed at 500 meters from
   the location. The distance between the first and fourth bump should be 100
   meters, and the distance between the fourth and the sixth should be 50 meters,
   so cars cannot travel fast in the direction of the building.

5. Barbed Wires: They should be placed around the building, around the walls,
   or on top of the walls.

6. Nails Obstacle
   These are placed at the main gate in order to puncture the tires of any car
   crashing in.

*Fences
Fences are the best form of permanent protection. It shields off all activities which
take place inside the location. The following should be considered when erecting
fences:
1. The fence which is built out of bricks or concrete should be 4 meters high, then
topped with one meter high barbed wire fence. It is preferable that the barbed
wires slant outwards at a 70 degrees angle.

2. The thickness of the fence should be 60 cm and the distance between it and the
building should be 2 meters.

3. Secret gates should be built 50 meters apart to be used for emergency only.
However, they should not be identifiable from the outside part of the fence.

4. It is preferable that any location has only 2 emergency gates and far away from
one another.

5. No other outside gates should be erected. If it is necessary to have an outside
entrance for the control tower, then access to the location should not be
constructed.

6. If the location is in a highly dangerous zone, then two parallel fences should be
built to be 3 meters apart. The space between the two fences could be mined in
order to prevent infiltration.
 7. It is preferable the fence be square or rectangular in shape. A circular shaped
fence is harder to protect because of hidden angles.

Parking:

Parking areas are of importance because most sabotage operations are done with
cars. Therefore, it is important to adopt following:

1. The parking lot should be 50 meters away from the fence. If the nature of the
terrain does not allow it, then it should be on the other side of the road.

(Document page 4)

2. Under no circumstance a car, even that which belongs to the location should be
permitted to park next to the fence.

3. Assign a parking spot for visitors which would not make them feel insulted.
Usually such parking spots are on the side of the lot.

4. Inside parking lot should be strictly designated to the location's cars in order to
protect them from sabotage. Also, the visitors with high security clearance should
be designated parking spots inside the location.

5. Cars parked inside the location should have their front facing the fence so they
could be used quickly in case of emergency.

6. All parking regulations of the location should be followed strictly followed.

Human protection
Buses
Some buses should be exposed and others should be camouflaged.
A. Exposed Busses
  One at the tip of the road
  One in front of the location
  One at the back of the location
  The buses should have the following:
  1. Light armor and rocket launchers
  2. Wireless equipment to report dangerous activities
  3. Writing materials to jot down suspicious activities or license plate numbers.
  4. Sand bags arounf the busses to protect them from gun fire.
 B. Camouflaged Buses
These are camouflaged to look like commercial companies' vehicles or traveling
salesmen's vehicles. They are entrusted with the task of tracking down the
movement of strangers who are approaching the location.

Kiosks:
The objective of having kiosks is they serve as communication points between the
guards and the visitors or those who are approaching the building and deal with
them according to their requirements. The following should be observed:
1. Kiosks should be placed at entrance gates to check visitors when approaching
the building.
2. Kiosks should be placed at key important locations where24 hour security
watch is required.
3. The Kiosk should be designed to stand all weather conditions, and provide a
full coverage of the area it is placed at.
4. The Kiosk should be equipped with wireless communication equipment, and a
mechanist to open and close the gate automatically.
5. Direct the visitors' cars to special parking spots, away from the fence and the
control tower.

Towers:
The following should be observed:
1. The lower part of the tower should serve as a shelter for the guards, when
needed. Going up the tower should be from inside.

(Document page 5)

2. The towers should be located in a manner where they can easily communicate
with one another, and totally cover the area they are guarding. They should have
telescopes in order to constantly control the areas around them.

3. Entrances to the towers should be totally camouflaged.

4. They should have a protruding area to better control their surroundings.

Outside Patrols
The locality cannot be fully protected without having patrols roaming on the
outside area of the fence. The above mentioned protection procedures are only for
observation purposes, while patrols check the fences, the barriers, and the towers,
and submit periodic reports on their findings. It also checks on guard posts.
 They also engage with persons approaching the locality and support the guards in
their duties. They also provide extra fire power in when guards or other patrols
are engaged in a gun battle.
These patrols are formed as follows:
1. Single patrols which consist of two people checking the outside area of the
location.
2. Common patrols which consist of one man and a dog, also checking the outside
area of the location. These patrols tour the area during specific times such as,
dinner, dawn, dusk, and midnight.
The patrol should be armed with light weapon such as Kalashnikovs and RPGs,
and cover the area on foot.

Area Patrols
These patrols comb the greater area surrounding the location periodically;
anywhere between 3 and four times a week The patrol should be lead by a
security officer in order to take immediate actions if the need arises. Also, the
duty of area patrols is to discover new paths and shelters in the area in order to
hide fighters after a Jihad operation against the enemy.
The area patrol is different from the single patrol in that:
1. It has a vehicle equipped with a machine gun.
2. It can use horses to canvass the area, but the patrol should be formed of 2 or 3
people at least.

Chapter Two
Internal Protection
This kind of protection should be done without drawing attention so that people
inside the location would feel at ease. The location should have a fence with
towers that is equipped with visual and aural equipment.
