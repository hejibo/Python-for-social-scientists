Speaking at a meeting with his Iranian counterpart President Mohammad Khatami, Chavez recalled the looming recession in world oil markets following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S., and remarked that cooperation among OPEC member states, particularly the Islamic Republic is a must to secure their interests. He further called on non-OPEC oil producers to cooperate with the organization to alleviate existing concerns over falling oil prices. President Khatami, for his part, highlighted a collective quest by OPEC member states to stabilize oil prices at a reasonable level. He reiterated OPEC's concern to ensure the interests of producers and consumers, and pledged for cooperation among the members of the organization to protect producers' interests and bring price stability to world oil markets. Elsewhere in his remarks, Khatami lashed out at the recent US-led attacks on Afghanistan, and voiced Iran's displeasure with developments in the war-ravaged country. He reiterated the need to set up a coalition government in Afghanistan comprising all Afghan groups to reinforce stability. Khatami and Chavez agreed that 'Dialogue Among Civilizations' could serve to mitigate clashes of civilizations and would also ensure a durable peace. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez whose country holds the rotating chairmanship of OPEC arrived at Tehran Sunday from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, for talks with President Khatami on oil related issues. He is scheduled to leave Tehran Sunday evening for Moscow to follow up his deliberations on the same subject with Russia as one of the most important non-OPEC oil producing countries. The Venezuelan president has been embarked on a tour of several European and African countries including Austria, Libya and Algeria in his efforts to garner support to prop up oil prices.
