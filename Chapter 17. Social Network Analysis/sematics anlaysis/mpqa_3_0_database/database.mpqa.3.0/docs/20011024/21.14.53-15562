 It was held during the ongoing 90th Session of the Chinese Export Commodities Fair from October 15 to 26 in this provincial capital of south China's Guangdong Province. 
	
	
 The forum attracted wide attention both at home and abroad, as China is to be admitted into the WTO at the forthcoming new round of WTO multilateral trade talks in Doha, Qatar, in November. 
	
	
 Over 200 economists, officials and entrepreneurs attended the forum. 
	
	
 Experts said the Chinese economy will have tremendous opportunities after China's entry to the WTO, while it will also face many challenges which will require accelerated and profound reform in enterprises, the financial system and social security. 
	
	
 Wu Jinglian, a leading Chinese economist, said the WTO agenda sets a transition period of only five years for China's adaption to the WTO rules and practices. 
	
	
 He suggested that the six major risks China will confront include the development of medium-sized and small enterprises, and the setting up of a sound social security system and a society ruled by law.
