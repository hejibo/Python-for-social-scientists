 Washington, March 4 (Yonhap) -- The U.S. State Department published its annual human rights country report Monday, reconfirming poor human rights conditions in North Korea. The "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001," submitted to Congress, said North Korea's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses. It also estimated that anywhere from several hundreds of thousands to two million people died from starvation and related diseases. Other human rights abuses in the North included extrajudicial executions and disappearances. "Citizens are detained arbitrarily, and many are held as political prisoners and prison conditions are harsh. The constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary and fair trials are not implemented in practice," the report said. On the other hand, the report described South Korea as "generally respecting the human rights of its citizens" although problems remain in some areas. The report pointed out as "remaining problems" in South Korea, police's physical or verbal abuses of detainees at times and the National Security Law (NSL)'s infringement upon free expression and other civil liberties. Other problems cited in the report include domestic violence, rape, child abuse, legal and societal discrimination against women and ethnic minorities. In particular, trafficking in persons was a problem. South Korea was cited in the report as a "major transit point for alien smugglers, including traffickers of primarily Asian women and children for the sex trade and domestic servitude." The report, however, noted the government has taken various steps to improve its human rights record. It also noted President Kim Dae-jung stated repeatedly that promoting the rights of women was a priority goal. In connection with freedom of speech and press, the report said the Seoul government abandoned direct control over the news media, but it continues to exercise indirect influence, and government officials vigorously lobby reporters and editors. It cited controversial massive tax probes of media firms which critics accused of being an attempt to curb media criticism of the government while the government maintained the tax audit was a legitimate activity and long overdue. Meanwhile, the report called Afghanistan "a triumph for human rights in 2001," saying that after the U.S.-led war on terrorism, Afghan citizens have been released from the brutal and oppressive rule of the Taliban and Afghan women, who suffered violence and repression, are now beginning to resume their roles in society. The report also noted improvement in human rights records in such countries as Bahrain, Peru, Qatar and Oman. cjs2001@yna.co.kr
