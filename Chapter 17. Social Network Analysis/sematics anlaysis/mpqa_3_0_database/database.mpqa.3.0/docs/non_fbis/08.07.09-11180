U.S. Closely Monitoring Situation in Argentina

 



  The Bush administration was closely monitoring the situation in 
Argentina where escalating economic crisis led to a wave of 
bloody street violence and looting, the White House said on 
Thursday.

  "Argentina is a valued ally and friend, and the United States is 
monitoring developments in Argentina. We are concerned about the 
events," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters at a 
regular news briefing.

  Argentine President Fernando De la Rua declared a national state 
of siege Wednesday night and ordered additional security forces 
into the streets to control violence that left at least six 
people dead and hundreds wounded or arrested. It was Argentina's 
worst unrest in a decade.
