Dostum's units are currently fighting near Mazar-e-Sharif, aiming, in particular, to seize control of populated areas in Samangan Province to block weapons supplies to Taleban units in Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum said in an interview published in the Tuesday edition of Moskovskiye Novosti. The general said he currently commands up to 18,000 men, and about 4,000 Taleban fighters "with military hardware" have already gone over to his side. The US air strikes have destroyed Taleban emplacements near Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum said. He also denied reports that the Taleban had concentrated large forces near the border with Uzbekistan. "There are no such forces on the border with Uzbekistan. In Hayraton, near the Uzbek town of Termez, there are slightly over 100 Taleban members, according to my estimations," he said. Dostum said he intends to serve in the future Afghan government, representing ethnic Uzbeks. Moreover, Taleban fighters "not stained with blood" could be in this government, too, he said. Dostum also favoured a possible return of Afghanistan's former King Mohammad Zaher Shah.
