 Presiding over an inter-agency conference on social order, Chang asked the police to catch the gangsters who allegedly detained Legislator Huang Hsien-chou at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Taipei. 
	
	
 Later that day, a man was arrested in Taipei in relation to the case. Chang Fu-shun, 27, is said to be the younger brother of Chang Hui-hua, who allegedly invited Huang to meet her at the hotel and who Huang claimed was in the hotel room when he was detained. 
	
	
 Huang claimed the previous day in Taichung that he had been trapped by the gangsters, who had pretended to be his political supporters. 
	
	
 Huang told reporters that the gangsters, who included at least two men and a woman, made an appointment to meet him at the hotel Dec. 26. When he arrived, he claimed, one of them offered him a drink and he lost consciousness after drinking it. 
	
	
 When he awoke, he found that his hands and feet had been bound. The gangsters demanded NT$2 million from him but finally settled for NT$800,000 which they withdrew using Huang's credit card. 
	
	
 Huang was released Dec. 31 and reported to police that day. 
	
	
 Huang revealed what he claimed to be the whole story at a news conference Wednesday night after press reports said he had in fact been caught with prostitutes in the hotel and blackmailed. 
	
	
 The police said that the hotel room had been paid for by a woman who checked in under the name of Lin An, which they said was an alias used by Chang Hui-hua.
