    Endeavour links to space station with delivery of fresh 3-man crew

 



  CAPE CANAVERAL -- Space shuttle Endeavour docked with the 
international space station Friday, delivering a new 
three-member crew to relieve the men who have been up there 
since August.

  The shuttle pulled up as the two spacecraft orbited 250 miles 
above the Polish-Ukrainian border, ending a two-day chase.

  Space station commander Frank Culbertson had eagerly awaited the 
arrival of Endeavour, his ride home. Although his four-month 
stay was quiet, the retired Navy fighter pilot said he felt 
isolated and frustrated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

  
His crewmates were two Russians.

  ``We're ready to see you guys,'' Culbertson radioed once 
Endeavour pulled within 1 1/2 miles. He watched as the shuttle, 
a ghostly white against the blackness of space, drew ever 
closer.

  As Endeavour slowly closed the final 40 feet, Culbertson rang 
the ship's bell aboard the space station and announced in the 
tradition of the high seas, ``Endeavour arriving.''

  Culbertson and his crewmates, Vladimir Dezhurov and Mikhail 
Tyurin, will move out of the space station today. Taking their 
places will be Russian Yuri Onufrienko, the next commander, and 
Americans Carl Walz and Daniel Bursch.

  
They will stay aboard until May.
