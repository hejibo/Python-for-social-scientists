	
AMMAN -- Authorities on Sunday [24 March] released an alleged business associate of Majd Shamayleh, the prime suspect in a bank fraud case under investigation, on JD1 million bail bond, nearly two weeks after he was detained in connection with this case, judicial sources said yesterday. 
	
	
 Munther Halasa was one of the six detainees suspected of involvement in the questionable bank loans case which the government referred to the State Security Court prosecutor for investigation. 
	
	
 The sources said Halasa also made a deposit of $6 million at the Central Bank of Jordan. 
	
	
 Two other suspects, who are clerks at the HSBC Bank, were released on bail last week. 
	
	
 Halasa and the other two suspects are out on bail pending further investigations, the sources said. 
	
	
 Fifty-five people, including former officials, businessmen and bankers are believed to be involved in the case. 
	
	
 The State Security Court has imposed a ban on news coverage of the investigations, citing Article 38 of the Press and Publications Law.
