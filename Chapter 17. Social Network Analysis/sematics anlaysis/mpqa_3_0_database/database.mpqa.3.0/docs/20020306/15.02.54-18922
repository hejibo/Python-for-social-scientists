This is taking place at a time when the government of [George W.] Bush has been identified as the top violator of human rights of the last Christian year because of the restrictions imposed on the American citizens under the excuse of fighting terrorism. So far the Bush administration has denied its citizens their legitimate rights, has set up military courts to try the people charged with terrorism without giving the accused the right of appeal or the basic right to appoint a lawyer. Moreover, the American administration has violated the rights of the minorities and in particular the Muslim minority who have migrated to America. The American administration is keeping the Taleban and Al-Qa'idah prisoners in metal cages named detention centres and it is refusing to identify them as prisoners of war. This is another example of human rights violations in America. Only after the extensive protest of the world [media] and the human rights organizations, the American administration was compelled to partially recognize this right. The most interesting point is that America has been expelled from membership of the international human rights organization, because of its repeated violation of human rights. How can, under such circumstances, America allow itself to express an opinion over the issue of human rights in other countries? It seems that America's unilateral policy does not identify any limits for itself. The American administration, during Bush's presidency in particular, has adopted unilateral policies over such international issues as the reduction of strategic arms, environmental concerns including the Kyoto protocol, proposal to set up an international criminal court and lately over the fight against terrorism. The State Department's current expression of view on human rights records of other countries is in fact the continuation of the same unilateral policy pursued by the American administration. That is, American administration assumes the right to interfere in all international issues and internal affairs of other countries, but itself does not care about the concern of the global community vis-a-vis the American policies which at times influence a large part of the world. It is a human virtue to express concern on human rights issues in the world, but the American authorities - after massacring thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan under the excuse of fighting terrorism which is still continuing - cannot expect the people of the world to take seriously the annual report issued by their Department of State on human rights. They cannot, therefore, blame the world for viewing such reports as a tool to advance America's foreign policy.
