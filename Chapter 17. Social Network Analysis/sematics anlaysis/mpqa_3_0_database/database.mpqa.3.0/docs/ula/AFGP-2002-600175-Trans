Articles and Instructions of Al Qaeda

Firstly : Duties

- 1 It is important and religiously rightful to keep Al Qaeda united. That will come by fearing God in

private and in public. The mighty Allah said, "Who fears Allah, Allah will remove his bad deeds and




                                              UNCLASSIFIED
                                             UNCLASSIFIED

reward him with good deeds." [Sura] Al Tullaq/Divorce [65:5]. And it will come by being friendly with

Al Qaeda brothers and all Muslims, by best behavior, avoiding differences, cooperation and working for

the good of the group. [Prophet Mohammd] said, peace upon him, "Love and compassion and sympathy

between believers is like the human body: if one part of the body is sick, all the other parts of the body

will come to its aid." mutafaq aley / agreed upon. [i.e., one of the accepted or canonical sayings of

Mohammed]

- 2 Maintaining good Islamic behavior, avoiding all forms of belligerent play, avoiding bad company and

confirming any news to the smallest detail. Mighty Allah said, "O believers, if a sinner comes to you

with news, verify it first, lest you attack someone ignorantly and later regret it." [Sura] Al

Hajrat/Apartments [49:6]. Maintaining good moral characteristics and obedience to the parents even if

they are infidels.

- 3 Eating kosher food. Prophet Mohammad said, "Allah is good, and He only accepts the good."

- 4 Maintaining as good physical fitness and military training as possible.

- 5 Do not talk about work which is delegated to you to anybody, even with Al Qaeda members. The only

person you are authorized to talk to is your direct superior. If you have been delegated to a mission with

other people, talking among the group must be supervised by the command.

- 6 Maintaining strong hold on your Islamic faith in general and the call for Al Jihad ideology in

particular, starting with your relatives and friends. Mighty Allah said, "Warn your close relatives." [Sura]

Al Shura'/Consultation. Sometimes you will be prevented from spreading these ideologies because your

work requires too much secrecy.

- 7 Guard the public money belonging to Al Qaeda. The Messenger of Allah said, peace upon him, "The

people who waste Allah's money, their reward will be the fire on Judgment Day." Roah Al Bukhari [a

collection of the Prophet's sayings made by Al Bukhari]

- 8 Give good advice to your superiors and Al Qaeda brothers, and don't deceive them.

Secondly : Vacations

                                            UNCLASSIFIED

Take refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. "They alone are true believers who believe in Allah and

his Messenger, and when they are with him on a matter of common concern, do not depart without

obtaining his leave." [Sura] Al Noor/The Light [24:62].

Page 3

- 1 Married member: for each 3 weeks of work, 1 week vacation, Al Qaeda reserves the right to withhold

the vacation up to 4 months in special occasions.

- 2 Single member: for each month of work, there will be 5 days vacation. Al Qaeda reserves the right

to withhold the vacation for an indeterminate period of time on special occasions.

- 3 Vacation travel application will be submitted 2 ï¿½ months prior to travel. Extra vacation time requests

will not be granted except in special circumstances.



Thirdly : Salaries and Travel Tickets

Take refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan. "Eat and drink without waste, Allah does not like

wastrels."

- 1 The salary for a married Mujahed brother is 6500 Pakistan rupees (six thousand and five hundred

rupees), and 500 rupees for each child additionally.

- 2 The monthly salary for a single Mujahed is 1,000 Pakistan rupees.

- 3 A single Mujahed who has completed one full year in the organization will be issued a round trip

ticket to his country with a one-month vacation. The member does not have the right to exchange the

ticket for money, if he chooses not to travel. The member has the right to exchange it to make Al Haj to

Mecca; Al Haj time will be deducted from his vacation time.

- 4 A married Mujahed and his family will have a one-month vacation and round trip ticket to his country

after completion of two years in the organization. The member does not have the right to exchange the

ticket for money, if he chooses not to travel.

- 5 The brother who wishes to leave Al Qaeda without legal excuse does not have the right to demand any

financial assistance or special favors when he departs.

                                           UNCLASSIFIED

Forthly : Rewards and Punishments

Take refuge in Allah from the evil Satan. "The answer of believers when they are called to Allah and his

Messenger that he may judge between them is, 'We hear and obey.' They are the ones who will prosper."

[Sura] Al Noor/The Light [24:52]. And Allah said, "When they are told, 'come to that which Allah has

revealed and to the Messenger,' you should see the hypocrites how they hesitate and turn their faces

away." [Sura] Al Nisa'/The Women [4:61]. And Allah said, "No believing men and women have any

choice in a matter after Allah has decided it. Whoever disobeys Allah and his Messenger has clearly lost

the way and gone astray." [Sura] Al Ahzab/The Allied Troops [33:36], and therefore:

- 1 Accomplish all Al Qaeda's different plans and missions according to the Shara'a Judicial System.

- 2 Differences between members regarding Al Qaeda missions will be judged by qualified Al Qaeda

members. This will be done through the direct superior up the chain of command to resolve the matter.

- 3 If the differences are not related to Al Qaeda's work, the judgment will be made either by qualified Al

Qaeda members or outside judges if the parties wish to do so. This does not include the Tempter's courts.

It means any court considered legitimate by Al Qaeda. This includes high-ranking Al Qaeda and

subordinates.



Fifthly : Advice

A - Maintain the conditions of religious equilibrium. Equilibrium is the fulfillment of the person's needs

for righteousness, which depends on the following: (1) Religious devotion, which is to fulfill religious

duties continuously, and to prevent oneself from falling into the ways of sin. (2) Embody the ideal of

manhood: this is by doing the right things, which will bring praise, and avoiding the wrong things,

which would bring shame. Allah said, "If they did what they had been advised to do, it would be better

for them and they would stand fast." [Sura] Al Nisa'/The Women, and Abu Al Drda' said, "O people,

good deeds before the fight, you are fighting with your good deeds." Fatah al Bari 24/6.

Page 4

B - Try your best and to the most of your ability to accomplish the rightful Al Qaeda goals. The Mighty

Allah said, "Fear Allah as much as you can." [Sura] Al Taghabun/Exposition [64:16], and [Prophet




                                             UNCLASSIFIED
                                            UNCLASSIFIED

Mohammed] said, peace upon him, "Whatever I order you, do the best you can," mutafaq aley / agreed

upon.   To do your best to the utmost of your ability is shown by the following:

(1) The best of your efforts should be to your religion, and not to worldly concerns or to your family.

"You tell them, 'If your fathers and sons, your brothers and wives and families and wealth, or the business

you fear may fail, and the mansions that you love, are dearer to you than Allah, his Messenger, and

struggling in his cause, then wait until Allah's command arrives, for Allah does not show transgressors the

way." [Sura] Al Tuba/Repentance [9:24] [Prophet Mohammed] said, peace upon him, "You are not a

believer until you love me more than your parents, your children and all the people." Roah al Bekhari.

(2) That your Jihad be in the service of your religion is more excellent than the infidel struggling for their

iniquity; their struggle is void. Allah said, "There are some people who have loves other than Allah; the

believer loves Allah more."

C.) Pursue the curriculum of religious law studies; take advantage of spare time to do so. That will

provide the Muslim brother with Islamic vision with regard to current events. But knowledge without

action is a curse to its owner; there is no value to knowledge without action.

D.) If you have a specialty, which is of value to Al Qaeda's goals, then tell your superior of it.

E.) We advise all brothers to avoid arguments in religion, and it is forbidden to speak on religion without

knowledge. If any differences occur, relay them to the qualified members. Allah said, "And when any

tidings of peace or war come to them they spread the news around. Had they gone to the Prophet or those

in authority among them, then those who check and scrutinize would have known it." [Sura] Al Nisa'

/The Women [4:83].



Sixthly : the Covenant

Its Purpose and Religious Lawfulness:

- 1 Draft Covenant:

Covenants among Moslems regarding obedience are permitted and lawful, in order to build trust among

the parties. The proof is in the saying of Allah to Jacob, peace be upon him,"He said, 'I will never send

him with you until you swear by Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless all of you are overtaken




                                              UNCLASSIFIED
                                            UNCLASSIFIED

(by misfortune).'' When all of them had given their promise, he said: "Allah is witness to our

conversation." [Sura] Yosef/Joseph [12:66]. If a Moslem gives his word he must keep it. As Allah said,

"And keep the covenant because you are responsible." [Sura] Al Isra' . And Allah said, "Fulfill your

covenant with Allah, having made the covenant, and do not break your oaths once you have sworn them,

as you have made Allah a witness over you." [Sura] Al Nahal/The Bees [16:91].



- 2 The purpose of the Covenant:

There are two types of covenants: the religious lawful duty, and the permissible. The religious lawful

duty, such as al-Jihad and the obedience to higher authorities, is every Muslim's duty by religious law.

In such a case, allegiance means enforcing the religious lawful duty. Even without allegiance, it is still a

lawful religious duty. While in the case of permissible matters, allegiance makes them religious lawful

duties. He founded this case on the saying of the Mighty Allah, "If you promise, you have to fulfill your

promise." Therefore Al Qaeda will take allegiance from its followers to include the obedience to its

policies and goals.

First of all, the Amir swears a Covenant



In the name of Allah the Most Benevolent, ever Merciful,

I swear allegiance to Allah, and with his accord to become a soldier among the Muslim soldiers, to

support the religion of Allah in order to make Allah's words supreme.



Covenant sworn by the brother, the Mujahed

In the name of Allah, the Most Benevolent, ever Merciful,

I swear allegiance to Allah, and with his accord to obey and listen to my superiors in good times and bad

times, in good situations and bad ones, to support the religion of Allah in order to make Allah's words

supreme, and to become a fighter in the name of Allah. To fight in any position through the duration of

the struggle, and to keep all the secrets of Al Qaeda's missions.

                                                 UNCLASSIFIED

Allah will be my guarantor of what I am saying.



Seventhly : Breach of Covenant

Punishment of the one who breaches the Covenant:

And Allah said, "As for those who break Allah's covenant after validating it, and sever relations which

Allah ordained cohered, and spread corruption in the land, there is condemnation for them and an evil

abode." [Sura] Al Rad/Thunder [13:25] And the Messenger of Allah said, peace be upon him,"Allah

said,'Three persons I am the opponent of on the Day of Judgment: a man who promised and broke his

promise; a man who made a sale and cheated, and a man who hired an employee and did not pay him."

Roah Al Bukhari. And Ibn Hajr explained, "He promised by Allah and then broke his promise." [Sura]

Fatah Al Bari 418 / 4



At last we pray praise to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.
