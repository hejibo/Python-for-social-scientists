   Veni, Vidi, Venezuela

 



  FIGHTING tyranny with tyranny clearly didn't work in oil-giant 
Venezuela last week. And now coup-plotting military officers and 
the reinstalled president, Hugo Chavez, need to show Latin 
America that their tyrannical tactics are at an end.

  President Chavez - a former Army coup-meister himself, who was 
elected three years ago - has abused his popular mandate with 
heavy-handed measures based on a Constitution largely rewritten 
by himself and his supporters. He has sometimes talked of 
remaining president past the year 2020. And his economic 
promises to the poor are in shreds, while his diplomatic 
flirtation with leftist world dictators only hints at his 
inclinations to gain more power.

  But Latin America has moved beyond coups, and this pivotal 
nation in a hemisphere of democracies has the means to remove 
Mr. Chavez by constitutional and especially nonviolent means.

  His two-day removal from office began when he tried to stack the 
board of the state-owned oil company in his favor. The company's 
executives revolted, threatening a cutoff of oil. That was a 
catalyst for pent-up opposition to Chavez. Business groups and 
labor unions joined in a giant protest, perhaps knowing that 
portions of the military were on their side. When gunshots were 
fired during a march on the presidential palace last Thursday, 
killing more than a dozen, military leaders forced Chavez to 
step aside. But then international pressure and renewed domestic 
support for Chavez forced the generals to let him take office 
again.

  The Bush administration all but welcomed the coup, tarnishing 
the US role as a champion of democracy. It, too, has a reason to 
repent.
