 Packages of the relief goods, collected by the Asia Africa Cooperation Environment Center (ACEC), went through customs in Osaka. They will be shipped to Islamabad on Tuesday from Narita airport, east of Tokyo, ACEC officials said. 
	
	
 At the request of the Red Crescent Society of Pakistan, ACEC has called for donations of relief goods on its Web site since early November. 
	
	
 On Friday, ACEC shipped some 200 kilograms of the 50 tons of relief goods it has collected. The rest of the goods will be shipped by sea early next year, the officials said. 
	
	
 ACEC is also calling for monetary donations because it needs more money to pay shipping costs, the officials said.
