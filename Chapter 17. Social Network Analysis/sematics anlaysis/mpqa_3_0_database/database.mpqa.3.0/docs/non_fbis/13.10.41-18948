  "SA wants Mugabe to accommodate the opposition in his new 
government to form a coalition government," said an official 
source. "They seem to think that this will resolve Zimbabwe's 
political crisis." However, the MDC dismissed the possibility of 
participation in such an arrangement.

  International condemnation of Mugabe's win mounted yesterday 
with US President George Bush and British Foreign Secretary Jack 
Straw delivering further criticism. Bush said: "We are dealing 
with our friends to figure out how to deal with this flawed 
election."

  Straw said Britain did "not recognise the result or its 
legitimacy". He hinted at a tougher policy against Mugabe, 
saying that the European Union would review sanctions at an 
upcoming summit meeting in Barcelona, Spain.
